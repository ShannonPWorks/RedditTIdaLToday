"The fact that Tidal has introduced UCP is big. If you want to support your favorite artists through streaming, this is the best way. Will have to see how it works out but that's definitely a plus.",hlmra2n,16,Liquid_Kurage,t3_qzhk4w,1637584533.0
"Biggest difference is audio quality. Tidals hifi plan is unrivaled, if you have a decent pair of headphones there's a noticable diffrence, spotify quality is not on the same level. Spotify does have a better interface though. Main Issue with the Tidal service is that its far too glitchy, when watching music videos through the Tidal app the video often skips or freezes, its not the internet connection I can play 4k videos on Youtube comfortably. Spotify doesnt have any of these technical problems, no buffering issues at all, better interface and an overall better experience. Once spotify brings in thier hifi plan Tidal will start bleeding subscribers and its their own fault, theyve had years to fix thier app and yet there's little to no improvement.",hlmybtc,9,Benzz1725,t3_qzhk4w,1637588688.0
"> Unfortunately Spotify Hi-Fi is coming in the nearest future  


""unfortunately"" lol

why? competition is good. I love tidal but its always great hearing other services offering lossless music too",hlnwpbo,5,Blackwater_7,t3_qzhk4w,1637603516.0
"Tidal is just different. Different interface, different feel. It can be had for cheaper than Spotify if you use Best Buy deal. I think no matter how you slice it, it’s at least competitive / similar if nothing else. Don’t worry, this service isn’t going anywhere. Jack Dorsey plans to integrate Tidal in with his other business platforms in various ways.",hlmmb20,9,CryptixI,t3_qzhk4w,1637580982.0
I have been waiting for 6 months for Spotify to add said features (especially HI-FI) and am likely to jump back to them when this is released because I used to love the service,hlmiy3o,3,bamb-,t3_qzhk4w,1637578245.0
"I hear what you’re saying. I think tidal has the potential to be so much better. For me the superiority is the sound quality. I love music and I invested in some decent headphones and I spend money on music stuff every month, new vinyls, any new books on musicians (‘Supersonic’ by Oasis) and to know that some of my money goes towards the artists compared to what Spotify is a good feeling. 

Id like to see album covers adjacent to the songs in my playlist. They only show up when you’re editing the playlist. Id like to know when discovering new artists what the more popular songs are on their album like the way Apple Music does. 

I think if tidal continue with their output on Master quality songs for most of their library then I think, for me as a customer, it would be hard to switch to anything else.",hlodblo,2,funkydisciple,t3_qzhk4w,1637610130.0
Spotify lossless music in 2021. Empty promises. They were so hurry to announce that lossless music would become available for fear of people switching to other service platforms. I am sure they had hardly even any plan on how to implement it.,hln8b9q,3,Ketsamo,t3_qzhk4w,1637593524.0
They pay the artists more and don't host/promote Joe Rogan. They just added gapless playback and so there is now no reason to ever return to Spotify.,hlnmxxd,4,dholmestar,t3_qzhk4w,1637599642.0

"Tidal is not doing a great job of different DAC support, but to be honest, I would change your title to be ""Fortunately, UAPP is a great solution for playing Tidal on Android""

UAPP to me is a much better solution from the standpoint of being able to tailor your listening experience and the broad support for all DACs.",hlngmld,2,skepticalifornia,t3_qzn53d,1637597069.0
"I think it's more of an android problem than Tidal. Or both in combination. UAPP did solve the same problem for me, but the problem only occured with high sensitivity headphones. My Meze 99 Classics (Low impedance and sensitivity) work great with Questyle M12 DAC - no pops and clicks. But when I try to play something on my iBasso SR2, it's just goddamn unbearable. UAPP solves it but I decided to refund because it doesn't play downloaded files, and my data plan is not so great. Still, I don't use my SR2's outside (open back), so I decided I don't even need it.",hlojxi3,1,Halucinogenije,t3_qzn53d,1637612795.0
"I never had a good experience with UAPP, I switched to an iPhone because of how bad the experience was when streaming over LTE. Planning on switching back to Android soon, hopefully whatever DAC I get to use with my phone works with the Tidal app, because I never want to have to use UAPP again.",hlno93m,0,Mii123me,t3_qzn53d,1637600168.0
"Not sure how fortunate it is, I had to pay an extra 12(11?) euros for it and I think the tidal interface is better...

We are very fortunate to have UAPP and for that to work well, and I think a small one time payment is very fair for it, but if would be great if tidal just worked. Or if androids didn't have this re-sampling issue.",hlnn2bm,2,joaojeronimo,t1_hlngmld,1637599691.0
"I agree with you there, Tidal should just make their app work correctly.

As an aside, UAPP's UI was recently updated, so it does look and function a lot better than before, but admittedly it still looks very engineering-centric from a design standpoint.",hlo2zf2,2,skepticalifornia,t1_hlnn2bm,1637605987.0

No crackle on Tidal desktop Hi-Fi. Are you streaming or playing from downloaded Tidal? I've had a few cases were downloaded tracks had playback errors (crackle/distortion).,hlp6lbr,1,Area51Resident,t3_qzlixa,1637622227.0
Yeah so official youtube version has no crackle so maybe is just the way it was uploaded to tidal i don't have a spotify so i can't compare that.,hln0aub,1,nklargy,t1_hlmzast,1637589721.0

"I don't have a solution for you, but it sounds like you have narrowed it down to a problem with the latest app update from Tidal. 

Seeing as how you are a longtime customer and like the product, it seems like you would be willing to wait for the patch to be released. I feel like all of the music services update their apps on a fairly frequent basis, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be an extended wait. 

I'm not sure if you've contacted Tidal support yet or not; they've been very helpful on the few occasions that I have needed them.

On the note of the low response to your last post, I can only give my opinion here, and that is that the number of posts in general in this sub since the new Tidal tiers were released has skyrocketed, and I think the helpful people are a little fatigued.

Best of luck with whatever you decide to do.",hll2xjc,2,Smart-Time6212,t3_qz9kfc,1637545004.0

"Might I add, the audio is distorted even at the lowest volume in my car, so it's not being distorted by the car speakers, but rather by the app itself. Audiophiles can probably better explain what I am getting at, but it's something to do with the app, not the server or the speakers or any user error.",hll17vt,1,hunterdietzman,t3_qz9kfc,1637544196.0
"In regards to it sounding distorted, you might check your phone EQ settings. You should have no EQ on for the best audio quality. 

I’m not sure what to think about the loudness issue. Do you have “loudness normalization“ on in the app?  If so, you could try turning that off and see if that helps.",hll2j41,1,HalusN8er,t3_qz9kfc,1637544820.0

I'm definitely willing! But each time it happens I just about throw my phone out the window... Lol,hll38oy,1,hunterdietzman,t1_hll2xjc,1637545151.0
"Tried turning that off and on, EQ is off on my phone, it's a Tidal problem, only on Tidal do I have this issue and it's only since the update. It's not just distorted, every song is I'd say 20% quieter than before, but then when this glitch happens, it literally like 10x in volume. Hard to describe. It's so jarring, each time it happens we literally have to take a minute to breathe. Scares the absolute shit out of us, it's that bad.",hll2wdu,1,hunterdietzman,t1_hll2j41,1637544989.0
"I’ve still got issues with some songs/albums just flat out refusing to play too. A few songs in my Discovery Daily playlist don’t play. Going to their respective albums, the whole album doesn’t play either. It’s all really bizarre and just makes Tidal a chore. I don’t know if a given song is going to play, and then if it does if it’s going to deafen me with static noise at any point.",hlo3lx3,1,DagsJT1,t1_hlnyo5w,1637606233.0
