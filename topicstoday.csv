Tidal’s advantages over Spotify,"There are many things that Tidal was/is doing better than Spotify - and those things were the reason for many of us to change to Tidal even tho sometimes, it meant paying even more. 

I am afraid that the amount of people switching to Tidal may decrease, because Spotify and other competitors are implementing the features that made Tidal better is some ways.

So I would say that there are 3 main features that Tidal has and Spotify is missing:

- Music Quality - probably the reason for most of us to switch to Tidal. Unfortunately Spotify Hi-Fi is coming in the nearest future

- Song Lyrics - this feature was implemented to Spotify years ago but later removed - now it’s back 

- Music Videos - that is the only thing on the list that spotify is missing and there are no info about implementing it


I don’t want it to look like I am criticizing Tidal. I am aware that the difference between sizes of development teams, budget etc between Spotify and Tidal is huge. I am simply afraid that in a couple of months there will be actually no reason to use Tidal over Spotify.

(also what is worth mentioning, I have only listed features that Tidal has and Spotify is missing. If I did the opposite list, it would be way longer)

What do you think, am I worrying for no reason or maybe there is something to worry about?",qzhk4w,0.81,17,Discussion,13,1637572919.0,t2_3fdrle6p,t2_3fdrle6p,2021-11-22 20:36:05.727515
"On spotify i'm used to every app (desktop, mobile etc) reflecting what is playing right now. But all my tidal apps seem to be independent. Is that correct?",,qzn1tz,1.0,6,Question,8,1637592490.0,t2_5fh67,t2_5fh67,2021-11-22 20:36:05.939029
"Sadly, UAPP seems to still be a requirement for playback on Android","I've been trying to figure out why I hear clicks and pops on songs, and magically, even with nothing playing but the Tidal app open on android. Different headphones and different DACs helped narrow down the problem to the Tidal app (or the phone?) itself, so I decided to try UAPP with the MQA addon, and boom, no clicks or pops, DACs with purple light.

My setup: tried the ifi zen dac v2 and the hidizs DH80S, with a OnePlus 8 Pro. Both dacs work fine connected to a windows PC.

Has anyone else had more luck than me? What's your setup?",qzn53d,1.0,6,Tech Issue,4,1637592745.0,t2_exl0b,t2_exl0b,2021-11-22 20:36:06.123518
"Sleep timer, please","First time on the subreddit, but is there no option to stop playback after a user-determined amount of time goes by? Or is it in the making perhaps?

Spotify has the timer option which was useful for when I’d fall asleep to Aphex Twin’s #13 playing on a 6-hour loop.",qzvjfn,1.0,0,Question,3,1637614431.0,t2_3ymlwbug,t2_3ymlwbug,2021-11-22 20:36:06.269535
Multiple online streams with Family?,"Hi all!

Thinking about coming back to Tidal (thanks to the HiFi upgrade), but wanted to know if the Family plan allowed for 6 accounts, or 6 simultaneous streams - I don’t feel like creating a bunch of dummy accounts but want to be able to stream at work while my wife streams at work while my daughter maybe streams, and maybe a few extras without having to make a separate account for each. Apple Music does it that way.

Thanks in advance!",qzuakg,1.0,2,Question,2,1637611256.0,t2_7qmrm86w,t2_7qmrm86w,2021-11-22 20:36:06.382972
Mr.Rager crackle in right ear,"Wanted to know if everyone has the same experience with this song on tidal, at least for me it happens 95% of the time the other 5% have been freak occurrences where there is no crackle. When you listen to the song its not immediate it only happens when it gets to the chorus when he says ""Mr. Rager"". i haven't tried spotify or youtube music to see if its present there too.

Distortion Issue (PLEASE ADDRESS),"Hello again Tidal Reddit! I wrote about this a couple of days ago, I'm sorry for double posting but this is a major problem and needs to be addressed.

THE ISSUE: I'll be playing a song in my car, using carplay, on my iPhone. Suddenly, out of absolutely nowhere the volume goes like 10x, and is SUPER distorted, has nearly blown out my speakers as well as almost caused me to crash TWICE, seriously guys, I'm not kidding the app is literally dangerous. I am going to give it a couple more days before I cancel my Tidal subscription. I hate to do it, but it happens every few songs, and there's no way to replicate it. For example, I'll play song #25, no problems, then 20 minutes later I'll play song #25 again and toward the end (always toward the end) it will have the problem, then I'll try to replicate the problem to get a video if it by replaying the song, this time it plays completely normally. I've been using Tidal for a couple of years now so I really would like to give them a chance to fix it, but my last post got very little attention and I don't see anything about it online.

&#x200B;

MY CONCLUSION: I have a background in technology. I believe the issue is client sided because my girlfriend didn't update her app and it played fine through her phone in carplay. Assuming it's pulling the same sound file off of the server, it's something the app is doing that is causing the problem. Additionally, all of my music is downloaded (yes, I tried this in offline mode) and it still happens when playing downloaded music.

VERY SAD: Unfortunately my girlfriend's phone was automatically pushed to the latest version of Tidal, and as soon as it was we started experiencing the same issues on her phone.

&#x200B;

Device: iPhone 13 pro max, and iPhone 13 pro

Car: 2021 Audi S4 (could be a coincidence, but it seemed to happen twice as often in my girlfriend's car, so if it's a carplay issue, her car is a BMW x3m

iOS: 15.1.1",qz9kfc,0.8,13,Tech Issue,3,1637544103.0,t2_6f0uf07u,t2_6f0uf07u,2021-11-22 20:36:06.729535
